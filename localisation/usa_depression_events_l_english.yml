 usa_depression.1.d:0 "The economic downturn has triggered a crisis in the banking sector. Hundreds of banks have failed across the country, wiping out the savings of countless American families. Remaining banks face 'runs' as panicked depositors withdraw their money, threatening the entire financial system with collapse. Some experts call for federal intervention to stabilize the situation, while others argue that weak institutions should be allowed to fail naturally."

 # First Hundred Days
 usa_depression.6.t:0 "The First Hundred Days Begin"
 usa_depression.6.d:0 "President Roosevelt has launched what observers are calling the 'First Hundred Days,' an unprecedented period of legislative activity to address the economic crisis. Congress is rapidly passing a series of major bills, including the Emergency Banking Act, the Economy Act, the Civilian Conservation Corps, the Tennessee Valley Authority, the Agricultural Adjustment Act, and the National Industrial Recovery Act. This flurry of legislation represents the most dramatic expansion of federal government activity in American history."

 # First New Deal Complete
 usa_depression.7.t:0 "The First New Deal"
 usa_depression.7.d:0 "The initial wave of New Deal legislation is now complete. President Roosevelt's administration has established numerous new agencies and programs to address the economic crisis. While critics argue that these measures represent dangerous government overreach, supporters point to rising employment numbers and increased economic activity as evidence of success. Banks have reopened, agricultural prices have stabilized, and industrial production is slowly increasing."

 # Supreme Court Fight
 usa_depression.8.t:0 "Supreme Court Challenges New Deal"
 usa_depression.8.d:0 "The Supreme Court has struck down several key New Deal programs as unconstitutional, including the National Industrial Recovery Act and the Agricultural Adjustment Act. Frustrated by these setbacks, President Roosevelt is considering a plan to expand the Supreme Court from nine to as many as fifteen justices, allowing him to appoint new members sympathetic to his agenda. Critics denounce this 'court-packing plan' as an attack on the independence of the judiciary."
 usa_depression.8.a:0 "Push forward with the court reform plan"
 usa_depression.8.b:0 "Accept the Court's limitations"
 
 # Court Packing Fails
 usa_depression.9.t:0 "Court-Packing Plan Fails"
 usa_depression.9.d:0 "President Roosevelt's plan to expand the Supreme Court has been defeated in Congress, with many members of his own party joining the opposition. This represents the first major political defeat for the administration and has weakened the President's influence in Congress. However, the Court itself has begun to show more flexibility in upholding New Deal legislation, perhaps influenced by the political pressure brought to bear."

 # 1937 Recession
 usa_depression.10.t:0 "The Recession of 1937"
 usa_depression.10.d:0 "Just as recovery from the Depression seemed underway, the economy has taken another downturn. Industrial production is falling, unemployment is rising, and the stock market has dropped sharply. Many economists blame the Federal Reserve's tightening of monetary policy and the administration's efforts to balance the budget by reducing government spending. President Roosevelt must decide whether to renew deficit spending or continue pursuing a balanced budget."

 usa_depression.11.d:0 "The renewed government spending program has successfully reversed the economic downturn. Industrial production is rising again, unemployment is falling, and investor confidence is returning. Although the federal budget remains unbalanced, the positive economic indicators suggest that the decision to prioritize recovery over budget balance was correct."

 # Recovery from 1937 Recession (Budget)
 usa_depression.12.t:0 "Slow Recovery from Recession"
 usa_depression.12.d:0 "The economy is finally showing signs of recovery after a prolonged period of difficulty. While the administration's commitment to fiscal restraint has meant a longer and deeper recession than some economists recommended, government finances are in better condition. The federal deficit has been reduced, though at the cost of higher unemployment and slower industrial growth than might have been possible with more aggressive intervention."

 # World War Approaches
 usa_depression.13.t:0 "Storm Clouds Gather in Europe"
 usa_depression.13.d:0 "Events in Europe suggest that another major war may be imminent. Germany's aggressive actions, Japan's expansion in Asia, and the failure of appeasement policies point toward potential global conflict. While most Americans remain firmly isolationist, defense planners warn that we must begin preparing for possible involvement. Increased military spending could also help fully overcome the lingering effects of the Depression."
