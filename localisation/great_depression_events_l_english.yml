 POLITICS_FRANKLIN_ROOSEVELT_DESC:0 "Franklin Delano Roosevelt, often referred to by his initials FDR, comes to the presidency at America's darkest economic hour. A patrician by birth but a champion of the common people by conviction, Roosevelt brings energy and optimism to the White House. His campaign promised a 'New Deal' for the American people, with active government intervention to address unemployment and economic collapse. Despite being partially paralyzed from polio, Roosevelt projects strength and confidence that has already begun to restore hope to a demoralized nation."
